A few weeks ago, I took up a challenge to learn Secure Code Reviews in 20 days. I chose PHP as the language to focus on and here are the resources I used to learn:

1. PentesterLab videos about different strategies to use while reviewing code
https://www.linkedin.com/company/pentesterlab/

2. Sonar Rules for code review rules/hacks to find vulnerabilities in PHP. This had great examples of compliant vs non-compliant code snippets. 
https://www.linkedin.com/company/sonarsource/
https://rules.sonarsource.com/php/type/Vulnerability

3. Looking for bugs in vulnerable apps like DVWA after finding their code on GitHub:

🌟 I highly recommend taking the API Penetration Testing course by Corey J. Ball on APIsec University 
https://university.apisec.ai/
https://www.linkedin.com/company/apisec-university/

👉 I had a blast working on this course. You will have the opportunity to learn and apply the concepts right after with a hands-on lab that you can install and deploy yourself.

👉 You will learn about the following topics
* Set Up an API Hacking lab
* API Reconnaissance
* Endpoint Analysis
* Scanning APIs
* API Authentication Attacks
* Exploiting API Authorization
* Testing for Improper Assets Management
* Mass Assignment
* Injection Attacks
* Rate Limit Testing
* Combining Tools and Techniques

🙏 I can not thank enough the team of APIsec University special mention to Corey J. Ball and Dan Barahona for all that you do for the community. 🙏

✅ GUIDE TO CYBER THREAT MODELLING by Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) 
This document aims to provide a practical and systematic way to identify threat events that can be used in a cybersecurity risk assessment.

It will introduce various approaches and methods of threat modelling, and provide a suggested framework, coupled with practical examples, for individuals and groups to adopt to derive a robust system threat model and
relevant threat events.

System owners can then incorporate these threat events into their cybersecurity risk assessment to develop and prioritise effective controls.

target audience:

* Internal stakeholders e.g. system owners, business unit heads, Chief Information Security Officers, and personnel involved in IT risk assessment and management within any organisation, including Critical Information Infrastructure Owners;
* External consultants or service providers engaged to conduct threat modelling on behalf of system owners; and 
* Red team members, blue team defenders, and purple team members.

2 APPROACH

2.1 System Level Approach

2.2 Common Missteps in Threat Modelling

2.3 Integrating Threat Modelling into Risk Assessment Process

3 METHODOLOGY

3.1 Overview of Method

3.2 Step 1: Preliminaries and Scope Definition

3.3 Step 2: System Decomposition

3.4 Step 3: Threat Identification

3.5 Step 4: Attack Modelling

3.6 Step 5: Bringing Everything Together


✅ Threat Modeling course by British Columbia Provincial Government

This training course is just one part of the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) Information Security Branch (ISB) education series.

The goal of this course is to inform staff of what threat modelling is, why it is important, and how it fits into the Security Threat Risk Assessment, and Statement of Acceptable Risk, processes.

Threat Modelling Frameworks

A threat modelling practice flows from a methodology or framework. There are many threat modelling frameworks available for use. Some of these are specialised models designed for a specific task, for example, some focus specifically on risk or on privacy concerns.

They can be optionally combined to create a more robust and well-rounded view of potential threats.

Threat modelling should be performed early in the development cycle because if potential issues arise, they can be caught early and remedied.
This can prevent a much costlier fix down the line.
Using threat modelling to think about security requirements can lead to proactive architectural decisions that help reduce threats right from the start.

Threat Modeling frameworks

- Microsoft STRIDE Threat Modelling Tool (Developer Focused)
- OWASP Application Threat modelling (Software Focused)
- OCTAVE (Practice Focused)
- Trike Threat modelling (Acceptable Risk Focused)
- P.A.S.T.A. Threat modelling (Attacker Focused)
- VAST Threat modelling (Enterprise Focused)

Threat Modelling Tools
- IriusRisk
- PyTM
- SecuriCAD
- ThreatModeler
- SD Elements

✅ Threat Modeling Architecting & Designing with Security in Mind by OWASP® Foundation - Venkatesh Jagannathan

Why do we create application threat models in the Software Development Life Cycle ?

SDLC refers to a methodology with clearly defined processes for creating high-quality software.

To identify potential flaws that have been there since the applications were created, threat modeling identifies risks and flaws affecting an application, no matter how old or new that application is.

Threat modeling should take place as soon as the architecture is in place as the cost of resolving issues generally increases further along in the SDLC.
